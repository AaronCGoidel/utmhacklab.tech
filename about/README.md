# What is the Hacklab?

The UTM Hacklab is an MCS department initiative made for the students of UTM. We're located in room 2014 in UTM's Deerfield Hall building. 

## A collaborative project space

Projects are an important component of a student candidate's evaluation package because technology companies are looking for students that:

- Have experienced the exploratory self-initiated nature of working on real world projects
- Have exposed themselves to similar processes and technologies involved in building projects in the industry. 

## We research and develop for the student community

Hacklab coordinators and members R&D processes and technologies that help students succeed academically and professionally.

With the interest of students in mind, we curate resources from around the internet and produce original content.

## The support wing for MCS societies

The UTM MCS community is home to a number of clubs that the Hacklab supports logistically and technically.
