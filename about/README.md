# What is the Hacklab?

[[toc]]

The UTM Hacklab is an MCS department initiative made for the students of UTM.

## A collaborative project space

Projects are an important component of a student candidate's evaluation package because technology companies are looking for students that:

- Have experienced the exploratory self-initiated nature of working on real world projects
- Have exposed themselves to similar processes and technologies involved in building projects in the industry. 

## We R&D tools for the student community

Hacklab coordinators and members R&D (Research and Develop) processes and technologies that help students succeed academically and professionally.

With the interest of students in mind, we curate resources from around the internet and produce original content. 

## The support wing for MCS societies

The UTM MCS community is home to a number of clubs that the Hacklab supports logistically and technically.


## How do I join the Hacklab?

The Hacklab is still setting up its near to long term infrastructure. 

At the moment, the best way to get involved is to check out the resources on this website, visit our [digital community on Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com), and engage with us in person by visiting our office at UTM in Deerfield Hall Room 2014.
