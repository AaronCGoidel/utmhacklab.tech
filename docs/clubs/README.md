## UTM Robotics Club

## UTM WISC

The Women in Science and Computing club (WiSC) aspires to provide a supportive community for students pursuing careers in STEM. We plan on creating opportunities for students of all genders to enhance their professional and personal development, and find peers who will support them on this path. Our goal is to start a conversation on equity, diversity, and inclusion in STEM and provide opportunities for minorities in STEM to flourish.

## UTM DSC
