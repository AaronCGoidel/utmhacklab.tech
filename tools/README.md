## Collaboration    

### Visual Studio Code Live Share

Live Share enables you to collaboratively edit and debug programming projectswith other students in real time. It works regardless what programming languages you're using or app types you're building. 

It allows you to instantly (and securely) share your current project, and then as needed, share debugging sessions, terminal instances, localhost web apps, and more!
