# Projects

UTM's Hacklab provides space and guidance for students to work on projects. We encourage students to explore areas of technology that they are passionate about by building exploratory or implementation projects.

## UTM Google Community Projects

UTM's [Google DSC Chapter](https://utm.developerstudentclubs.ca/) launched a community projects program this year.

Students interested in developing software projects have paired up with upper year mentors and university professors to build projects for Google's community project showcase.

## Student Projects

The Hacklab provides technical support and mentorship to students working on projects outside of their coursework.

You can reach out to the student contributors via their emails on [Outlook](https://outlook.office365.com) or [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) involved in the project to see how you can get involved!

If you have a project you'd like featured, you can:

- Connect with a coordinator on our [digital community on Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com)

- Engage with us in person by visiting our office at UTM in Deerfield Hall Room 2014. Check out our office hour timings [here](/office-hours)
