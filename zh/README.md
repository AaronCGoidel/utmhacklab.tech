<!-- # What is the Hacklab? -->
# Hacklab 是什么？

The UTM Hacklab is an MCS department initiative made for the students of UTM. We're located in room 2014 in UTM's Deerfield Hall building. 

## How do I join the Hacklab?

The Hacklab is still setting up its near to long term infrastructure. 

At the moment, the best way to get involved is to check out the resources on this website, visit our [digital community on Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com), and engage with us in person by visiting our office at UTM in Deerfield Hall Room 2014. Check out our office hour timings [here](/office-hours)

Don't be shy

If you come visit us in person when our doors are open, we'll do our best to ensure that you are heard :slightly_smiling_face:
