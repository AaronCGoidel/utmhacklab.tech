## Tech Internships

Internships are an excellent way to get co-op education experience, and as a UTM Student, a wide variety of internships are available to you. 

### [Where do I apply?](/resources/internship-apps)

### How do I prepare for interviews?

Interviews are a multi-stage process and each stage can consist of vastly different formats.

<!-- ## Web Development -->


## Design

You may want to use design to explain, to tell a story, to plan, to problem-solve, or to make something look nice. These are all goals you can achieve through designing. 

Often, people think design is about the way things look. That’s just one element of design. Find our more about design [here](/resources/design)

## Getting Motivated

It’s a wonderful feeling to be motivated about what you’re learning. Consuming entertaining digital content about your area of education can help you cultivate a sense of wonder.

### [PBS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)

PBS makes Computer Science education accessible to people of all ages, and this crash course goes into a surprising amount of technical detail. 

::: tip CS Education for everyone
I have often used this channel as a guide to provide context for when the content as its taught by professors becomes a bit too technical.

## Collaboration    

### Visual Studio Code Live Share

Live Share enables you to collaboratively edit and debug programming projectswith other students in real time. It works regardless what programming languages you're using or app types you're building. 

It allows you to instantly (and securely) share your current project, and then as needed, share debugging sessions, terminal instances, localhost web apps, and more!
