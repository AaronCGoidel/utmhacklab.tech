## What is REST?

Representational state transfer, also known as REST, is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. By using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations, it allows any systems to request and access the web resources.

## Why use REST

REST allows web services to have faster performance, reliability and ease of access. This is all achieved by using a stateless protocol and standard operations.

The API also enables systems to easily communicate with each other, as long as they are connected to the web. This can include: 2 different computer systems communicating with each other, or a system communicating and retrieving data from a database

One of the most important uses of REST is that it allows the use of microservice, which is a very important concept as we start working with larger web services.
