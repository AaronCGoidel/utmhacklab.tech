## General Guidance

### Google

**Your resume is the first piece of information employers see about you. Here’s how to highlight your achievements:**

- Align your skills and experience with the internship or job description

- Be specific about projects you’ve worked on or managed. What was the outcome? How did you measure success?

- If you've had a leadership role in a volunteer organization or at a part-time job, tell us about it. How big was the team? What was the scope of your work?

- Include your GPA, as well as school-related projects or coursework that demonstrate relevant skills and knowledge **as you see fit**

- Keep it short: Aim for one page. If there’s additional information we need during the hiring process, (like a portfolio), your recruiter will work with you to collect it
