## Web Content Accessibility Guide 2.0 (WCAG 2.0)
Your web application is something that everyone should be able to use. Often, some of your users may require certain accesibility features on your web application so that they may experience the full benefits of your application. Many regions have requirements for web content accessibility as part of their legislation (such as Ontario as part of the AODA). Luckily, the W3 Consortium has published international guidelines on web content accessibility in what is know as 'WCAG 2.0'
