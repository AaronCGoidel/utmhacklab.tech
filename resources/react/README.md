# React

## What is React
React (also known as ReactJS or React.js) is an open-source declarative, efficient and flexiable JavaScript library for building user interface. 

It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components". React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile application.

React was developed by Facebook and first deployed in Facebook News Feed in 2011.
